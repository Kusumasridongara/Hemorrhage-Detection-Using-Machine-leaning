# Hemorrhage Detection using Machine Learning

This project aims to detect brain hemorrhage based on patient demographic data and diagnostic labels using machine learning algorithms.

## 📁 Dataset
The project uses two datasets:
- `patient_demographics.csv`: Contains age, gender, and other relevant patient details.
- `hemorrhage_diagnosis.csv`: Contains diagnosis labels indicating presence or absence of hemorrhage.

## ⚙️ Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables).
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and correlations.
- Model training using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
- Evaluation using Accuracy and Log Loss metrics.
- Best accuracy achieved: **92% with Random Forest**.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Results
- Random Forest outperformed other models with the highest accuracy.
- Heatmaps and confusion matrices were used to interpret model performance.

## 📌 Conclusion
This model provides a reliable approach for early hemorrhage detection based on structured data, aiding clinical decision-making.

## 🧠 Future Work
- Integration with real-time hospital systems.
- Extension using image data and deep learning (e.g., CT scan images).
